### Hey there, I'm Nicholas ðŸ‘‹
I'm Nicholas Bates, a second year engineering student. I specialise in Computer Systems Engineering at the University of Auckland.

I am pursuing a career in tech because I am perpetually captivated by the wonder of computing and the challenges that can be solved through effective use of the appropriate tools. I started my programming journey in middle-school, where I started to learn web development and from then I moved to mobile application development, database programming and finally open source game development. I thoroughly enjoy the programming process which is why I have stayed the path for all these years! I look forward to seeing where this path takes me into the future.

Presently, I am an active contributor to the [Moving Blocks](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/) organisation where I am a primary contributor to the space arcade game [Destination Sol](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/DestinationSol). I am currently mentoring a [student](https://github.com/IsaacLic/) through the ambitious [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program, in which he is spending three months converting much of the Destination Sol code-base to an Entity Component system, for greatly improved moding support and integration with existing Moving Blocks tooling. Alongside this, I frequently contribute code, documentation, review and other miscellaneous tasks as requested both on the Destination Sol game and elsewhere in the organisation.

#### Here are a couple of my programming highlights:
- [Google Code-In](https://codein.withgoogle.com/) finalist 2017
- Coaching both young students from [Google Code-In](https://codein.withgoogle.com/) and older students in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
- Proactive contributor to open source projects Terasology and Destination Sol since 2016
